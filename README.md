## 📌 Overview

The Loan Decision Model is a web-based application designed to predict loan approval outcomes using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing applicant data, the system provides instant decisions, streamlining the loan approval process for financial institutions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for real-time user interaction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes both baseline models and XGBoost classifiers for prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical and numerical data efficiently.
- **Logging Mechanism**: Records predictions and inputs for auditing and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Incorporates a professional UI with a banking-themed background.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

The application employs two primary models:

1. **Baseline Model**: A simple classifier serving as a benchmark.
2. **XGBoost Classifier**: An advanced model known for its performance on structured data.

Both models are trained on historical loan data, considering features like income, employment length, loan amount, and more.

## 🖥️ Application Interface

The user interface is crafted for clarity and ease of use:

- **Input Fields**: Users can enter applicant details such as loan amount, interest rate, employment length, etc.
- **Prediction Output**: Displays whether the loan is approved or rejected, along with the probability score.
- **Summary Table**: Provides a recap of the entered information for verification.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yechyn/loan-decision-model.git
   cd loan-decision-model
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app/loan_prediction_app.py
   ```

   The application will open in your default web browser.

## 📝 Logging

All user inputs and prediction results are logged in the `app/output.log` file. This ensures transparency and aids in monitoring application usage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **XGBoost**: Machine learning model for prediction.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Joblib**: Model serialization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Additional machine learning utilities.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Model Interpretability**: Integrate SHAP or LIME for explaining model decisions.
- **Database Integration**: Store user inputs and predictions in a database.
- **Authentication**: Add user login functionality for secure access.
